    <h1>Invader ZIM</h1>

    <p>
      A Nickelodeon cartoon from the early 2000s, Invader Zim is about Zim - a
      small bug-like alien with green skin, pink eyes, and a love for
      destruction -, Dib - an 11-year-old boy with dreams of becoming a
      professional paranormal investigator -, and their fight over the fate of
      all mankind.
    </p>
    <h3>ZIM! Irken Invader</h3>
    <p>
      Zim is a member of the feared Irken Race - conquerors of large sections of
      the known universe. Tasked with the subtle infiltration of Earth and given
      his trusty sidekick, Gir, from the Leaders of the Irken Empire - the
      Almighty Tallests - Zim set out to complete his mission to prepare the
      planet for the coming invasion as one of the Invaders responsible for
      enacting Operation Impending Doom II.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unbeknownst to Zim however, Almighty Tallest Red and Almighty Tallest
      Purple have banished Zim under the guise of a mission. During Operation
      Impending Doom I, Zim accidentally blew up all the other Invaders. Because
      of this, Zim was banished to the snacking planet: FoodCourtia. Upon
      hearing the news that the Invaders for Operation Impending Doom II were
      being given their assignments however, Zim quit being banished and crashed
      the Great Assigning.
    </p>
    <h3>Dib Membrane</h3>
    <p>
      Son of the greatest scientist to ever exist, Dib strives to provide the
      world irrefutable proof of the existence of paranormal entities.
      Unfortunately for Dib, Professor Membrane - his father and the most
      forefront expert on all things science - is always wary of his son's so
      called 'parascience' and often quick to disprove Dib's theories.
    </p>
    <p>
      After Zim's arrival on Earth, Dib's life quickly begins to revolve around
      stopping Zim's evil plans. Despite Zim's terrible disguise, most humans
      are quick to believe Zim when he claims his green skin and lack of ears
      are the result of a skin condition. Dib is not most people. This newfound
      paranoia and outspoken claims of one of his seemingly normal peers being
      an alien quickly begins to isolate Dib from his fellow students even more
      than before. A combination of consistently being called crazy and a lack
      of socialization quickly results in Dib becoming more manic than ever
      before.
