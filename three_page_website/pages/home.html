        <em>Labyrinth</em> (1986) is a fantasy film directed by Jim Henson and
        executive produced by George Lucas. The story follows
        <strong>Sarah Williams</strong> (played by Jennifer Connelly), a teenage
        girl who accidentally wishes her baby half-brother Toby away to the
        Goblin King, <strong>Jareth</strong> (played by David Bowie).<br><br>To rescue
        Toby, Sarah must navigate a magical, ever-changing labyrinth within 13
        hours or he will be turned into a goblin forever. Along the way, she
        meets a cast of fantastical creatures, including Hoggle (a grumpy
        dwarf), Ludo (a gentle giant), and Sir Didymus (a fox-like knight). The
        film blends puppetry, musical performances (featuring songs by Bowie),
        and surreal imagery. 
        <br><br><em>Labyrinth</em> explores themes of growing up,
        personal responsibility, and self-discovery, and while it was not a
        major box office success initially, it has since gained a strong cult
        following.
